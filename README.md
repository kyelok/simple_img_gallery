# simple_img_gallery
The simplest way to make a static image library, with only a little Python, minimal HTML, and nothing else

## Install

	none, no dependencies other than Python and Firefox

## Instructions

	python generate_gallery.py sample_images

Alternatively, instead of `sample_images`, pass a full path to a directory of images of your choice.

Note:

- Currently only supports 3-images-in-a-row tiling.
- Currently only supports tiling the images in alphabetical order.

Future features:

- Support n-tiling
- Support randomization, down-sampling
